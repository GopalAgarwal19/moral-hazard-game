    <h1>Scenario 1: General Instructions</h1>
    <br><br>
    You are a self-employed person.
    <br><br>
    Your initial capital or savings until now is $10,000.
    <br><br>
    Your quarterly earnings are $3000<br><br>
    This means, every 3 months you get this income and it will increase your savings by $3000
    <br><br>
    E.g. your Cumulative Economic Value (CEV) at end of first quarter will be $10,000 + $3,000 = $13,000.
    <br><br>
    Your goal is to maximise your Cumulative Economic Value (CEV) by end of 3 years.
    
    If you fall sick, then you have two options:<br><br>
    1. Status quo (do nothing): Then illness depcreciates/reduces your cumulative economic value by the
    amount of Cost of Illness;<br><br>
    2. Seek healthcare: The cost of healthcare is indicated by Cost of Care. Seeking care has
    additional time cost indicated by number or hours. Each hour of care costs $10. Seeking healthcare reduces your
    cumulatives economic value by [Cost of Care + Time Cost].<br><br>
    Thus, you either reduce CEV by [Cost of Illness] or by [Cost of Care + Time Cost]<br><br>
    In middle of each year, you have the option of getting an annual examination. The cost of
    examination and time cost is indicated. Your CEV will be reduced by [Cost of Examination + Time Cost]
    <br><br>
    Make your decision at point and maximise your CEV
