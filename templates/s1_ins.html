    <h1>Scenario 1: General Instructions</h1>
    <br><br>
    You are a self-employed person.
    <br><br>
    Your initial capital or <b>savings until now is $10,000.</b>
    <br><br>
    Your <b></b>quarterly earnings are $3000</b><br><br>
    This means, every 3 months you get this income and it will increase your savings by $3000
    <br><br>
    E.g. your Cumulative Economic Value (CEV) at end of first quarter will be <b>$10,000 + $3,000 = $13,000.</b>
    <br><br>
    Your goal is to <b>maximise your Cumulative Economic Value (CEV) by end of 3 years.</b>
    
    If you fall sick, then you have two options:<br><br>
    <b>1. Status quo (do nothing):</b> Then illness depcreciates/reduces your cumulative economic value by the
    amount of <b>Cost of Illness</b>;<br><br>
    <b>2. Seek healthcare:</b> The cost of healthcare is indicated by <b>Cost of Care</b>. Seeking care has
    additional time cost indicated by number or hours. <b>Each hour of care costs $10</b>. Seeking healthcare reduces your
    cumulatives economic value by <b>[Cost of Care + Time Cost]</b>.<br><br>
    Thus, you <b>either reduce CEV by [Cost of Illness] or by [Cost of Care + Time Cost]</b><br><br>
    In middle of each year, you have the <b>option of getting an annual examination</b>. The cost of
    examination and time cost is indicated. Your <b>CEV will be reduced by [Cost of Examination + Time Cost]</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Make your decision at point and maximise your CEV</b>
